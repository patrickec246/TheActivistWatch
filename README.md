ActivistWatch is an application that connects activists with organizations to help promote activism. ActivistWatch brings together organizers who are hosting events and activists who are looking for causes to be a part of.

## Installation ##

ActivistWatch is coded in Android Java and is only compatible on Android devices. 

#### Requirements (requires one of the following) ####

* An Android Device with Android KitKat (v4.4, API level 19) or sooner.
* OR Android Studio with an Android Emulator (v4.4, API level 19 or sooner) installed.

#### Installation Instructions:

* Ideally, ActivistWatch will be hosted on the Google Play store. To download, simply search "ActivistWatch" and install the official ActivistWatch application. No further setup is required.

Until ActivistWatch is on the play store:
* If not installed, please install Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
* Open Android Studio and select "Import Project from Existing Sources"
* Select "Version Control", and type "https://github.com/rakshamuth/TheActivistWatch.git" in the box. Select "Next" until you get to "Finish"
* Once completed, hit the "Run" button at the top. If you have an Android Device connected via USB, you will be prompted to run on your device, otherwise, it will ask you to create a Virtual Android Device
   * If you do not have an Android Device, select "Create New Android Device," select "API 21" and "Install"
   * After this has installed, select the Android Device created, and hit "Start" (once the Android Device has loaded, you may need to hit the run button again)
   
Voila! The application will run on the simulator!
